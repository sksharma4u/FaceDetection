# Facial-Mask-Detection-System
Facial Mask Detection is a Python Program that help to detect the person is wearing facial mask in real time. Its Objective is to recognize the person on image/video stream wearing face mask with help of Computer vision and deep learning. If Several faces are present, each face is bounded by a red or green box and thus we know the position of the faces. The goal to design a binary face Classifier which can detect facial Mask. The model requires inputting an RGB image of any random size. This Classifier is implemented in Keras, and the output of the model is a feature vector
Through Facial Mask detection System We are able is easily detected mask from persons faces without contacting them. Also the problem of mistaken predictions has been solved and a proper bounding box has been drawn around the required region. This project can identify multiple faces from single image. The method can find applications in advanced tasks such as facial part detection.
To limit the spread of the disease, mandatory face-mask rules are now becoming common in public settings around the world. Additionally, many public service providers require customers to wear facemasks in accordance with predefined rules (e.g., covering both mouth and nose) when using public services. Corporate giants working on Machine learning and artificial intelligence at the service of humanity amid the pandemic.
